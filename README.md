Script for Firefox addon Greasemonkey that adds a simple fullscreen button to the SkyGo website.

It allows you to watch streams in fullscreen mode (just uses full viewport size) so you don't need Silverlight's fullscreen mode anymore. The Silverlight fullscreen mode aborts if you loose the window focus.
